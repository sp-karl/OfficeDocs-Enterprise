description: "If your organization uses Office 365 and restricts computers on your network from connecting to the Internet, below you'll find the endpoints (FQDNs, Ports, URLs, and IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges) that you should include in your outbound allow lists to ensure your computers can successfully use Office 365."

# Office 365 Germany endpoints

 *Applies To: Office 365 Admin*

**Summary:** Office 365 requires connectivity to the Internet. The endpoints below should be reachable for customers using **Office 365 Germany** plans only.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft has released a REST-based web service for the IP address and FQDN entries on this page. This new service will help you configure and update network perimeter devices such as firewalls and proxy servers. You can download the list of endpoints, the current version of the list, or specific changes. This service replaces the XML document linked from this page, which was deprecated on October 2, 2018. To try out this new service, go to [Web service](office-365-ip-web-service.md).
 
 **Office 365 endpoints:** [Worldwide (including GCC)](urls-and-ip-address-ranges.md)  | [Office 365 operated by 21 Vianet](urls-and-ip-address-ranges-21vianet.md)  | *Office 365 Germany* | [Office 365 U.S. Government DoD](office-365-u-s-government-dod-endpoints.md) | [Office 365 U.S. Government GCC High](office-365-u-s-government-gcc-high-endpoints.md)  |

Start with [Managing Office 365 endpoints](managing-office-365-endpoints.md) to understand our recommendations for managing network connectivity using this data. Endpoints data is updated at the beginning of each month with new IP Addresses and URLs published 30 days in advance of being active. This lets customers who do not yet have automated updates to complete their processes before new connectivity is required. Endpoints may also be updated during the month if needed to address support escalations, security incidents, or other immediate operational requirements. You can always refer to the [change log subscription](https://endpoints.office.com/version/Germany?allversions=true&format=rss&clientrequestid=b10c5ed1-bad1-445f-b386-b919946339a7).

The data shown on this page below is all generated from the REST-based web services. If you are using a script or a network device to access this data, you should go to the [Web service](office-365-ip-web-service.md) directly.

Endpoint data below lists requirements for connectivity from a user’s machine to Office 365. It does not include network connections from Microsoft into a customer network, sometimes called hybrid or inbound network connections.

The endpoints are grouped into four service areas. The first three service areas can be independently selected for connectivity. The fourth service area is a common dependency (called Microsoft 365 Common and Office) and must always have network connectivity.

Data columns shown are:

- **ID**: The ID number of the row, also known as an endpoint set. This ID is the same as is returned by the web service for the endpoint set.

- **Category**: Shows whether the endpoint set is categorized as “Optimize”, “Allow”, or “Default”. You can read about these categories and guidance for management of them at [http://aka.ms/pnc](http://aka.ms/pnc). This column also lists which endpoint sets are required to have network connectivity. For endpoint sets which are not required to have network connectivity, we provide notes in this field to indicate what functionality would be missing if the endpoint set is blocked. If you are excluding an entire service area, the endpoint sets listed as required do not require connectivity.

- **ER**: This is **Yes** if the endpoint set is supported over Azure ExpressRoute with Office 365 route prefixes. The BGP community that includes the route prefixes shown aligns with the service area listed. When ER is **No**, this means that ExpressRoute is not supported for this endpoint set. However, it should not be assumed that no routes are advertised for an endpoint set where ER is **No**.

- **Addresses**: Lists the FQDNs or wildcard domain names and IP Address ranges for the endpoint set. Note that an IP Address range is in CIDR format and may include many individual IP Addresses in the specified network.
 
- **Ports**: Lists the TCP or UDP ports that are combined with the Addresses to form the network endpoint. You may notice some duplication in IP Address ranges where there are different ports listed.
